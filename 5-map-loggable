# Sometimes, Nginx access logs can become very noisy. But, they can also have valuable informations. 
# If you want to simply log 400 and 500 errors to help you identify issues 
# (internal errors, 404â€™s, authorization errors, etc), you can use the following snippet for it.

map $status $loggable
{
    ~^[2] 0;
    ~^[3] 0;
    default 1;
}

server {
   listen 80;
   server_name localhost;
   access_log /var/log/nginx/access.log combined if=$loggable;
   error_page  500 502 503 504 = @error503;
   location @error503 {
       return 503 'Rejected';
   }
   location / {
       return 500;
   }
   location /ok {
       return 200 "OK";
}
}


#  tail -f /var/log/nginx/access.log
#  $ curl http://localhost/ok   --> Not logged 
#  $ curl http://localhost/ok   --> Logged
#
#  If you want to start logging other type of errors or more specific status codes,
#  you just need to adjust the regex and return either 0 (to not log in the access log) or 1 (to log in the access log).
